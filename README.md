# AI_Enabled_Water_Well_Predictor

Developed an AI-driven system to assess the feasibility of drilling water wells, predict stable water levels, and determine optimal drilling techniques based on geological formations. This solution leverages machine learning algorithms for precise and actionable insights. The K-Neighbors Classifier categorizes geological formations, aiding in terrain identification, while the Random Forest Regressor predicts drilling feasibility and estimates stable water levels with an impressive RÂ² score of 90%, demonstrating high predictive accuracy. This AI-enabled approach significantly enhances decision-making in water well drilling projects.
